Introduction
============

Background
----------

For the last few years I have been specializing at web scraping and collected what I found useful into this library.

All code is pure Python and has been run across multiple Linux servers, Windows machines, as well as `Google App Engine <http://code.google.com/appengine/>`_.


Install
-------

Some options to install the webscraping package:

#. Checkout the repository: *hg clone https://code.google.com/p/webscraping/*
#. Download the zip: http://webscraping.googlecode.com/files/webscraping.zip
#. Install with pypi: *pip install webscraping*

The only dependency is python 2.5 or higher.
